## Project Description
I've chosen to build a game of tic-tac-toe to improve my use of functions, lists, loops and other basic Python tools. The game will be player vs machine.

## Rules
The game is very simple. The player and the cpu will take turns filling the spaces of a 3*3 grid, and whoever marks three spaces in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) wins.

## Workflow
The first step was researching the game and what kind of data structures would serve me better to hold the necessary data. After drawing a basic template of the game I wanted to create, list the necessary functions and define in pseudocode a rudimentary game loop I began to code.

## Organization
I used a Trello board to make a basic list of the tasks I'd have to perform. I also used several drafts and drawings using pen and paper.
